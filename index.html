<p>The idea of this page is to eventually have a list of live links and images to some of my more recent work. For now, I'll just leave you with a list of links, until I get something proper added here.</p>

<a href="www.sassquad.com/test">Current portfolio site</a> - this is a bit old, and as it's using a third party template, it was something I put together quickly as I was unhappy with modding my current site. It's been on the same basic template since 2007!</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/renew/">Renew your UK passport</a> - One of the cornerstone projects for The UK Home Office, the UK adult passport renewal service was launched as a public beta in June 2016, having been an invite only closed beta since the start of 2016. The service allows you to apply for a new passport online, featuring upload of photos from your camera or smartphone, which can then assess their suitability.</li>

<a href="http://www.cityam.com/profile/stephen-scott">City AM profile portfolio</a> - I produced a variety of D3.js visualisations for the free newspaper's digital presence, culminating in the 2015 UK General Election results map. I produced a <a href="http://codepen.io/sassquad/pen/qZRaOd">Codepen</a> of it for inspection.</li>
