For now, I'll just leave you with a list of links, until I get something proper added here.\r\n\r\n### Current portfolio sites\r\n\r\n* [www.sassquad.com](www.sassquad.com)\r\n* [Current portfolio site] (www.sassquad.com/test) - this is a bit old, and as it's using a third party template, it was something I put together quickly as I was unhappy with modding my current site. It's been on the same basic template since 2007!\r\n\r\n### Most recent work\r\n\r\n* [Renew your UK passport](https://www.passport.service.gov.uk/renew/) - One of the cornerstone projects for The UK Home Office, the UK adult passport renewal service was launched as a public beta in June 2016, having been an invite only closed beta since the start of 2016. The service allows you to apply for a new passport online, featuring upload of photos from your camera or smartphone, which can then assess their suitability.\r\n* [City AM profile portfolio](http://www.cityam.com/profile/stephen-scott) - I produced a variety of D3.js visualisations for the free newspaper's digital presence, culminating in the 2015 UK General Election results map. I produced a [Codepen](http://codepen.io/sassquad/pen/qZRaOd) of it for inspection.\r\n",
